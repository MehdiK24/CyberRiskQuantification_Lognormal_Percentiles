# CRQ_Lognormal_Precentiles
Calculates financial impact of Cyber incident with only 2 values (sparse data)

# Description
The code is a very simplified example on how to calculate the financial impact of a Cyber security incident. To illustrate the idea, I use simulations using a Lognormal Distribution when I only have 5th and 95th percentiles.
